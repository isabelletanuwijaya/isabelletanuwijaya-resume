        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Isabelle Tanuwijaya. I am currently an undergrad student at the University of California, Riverside. I just completed my first year and am coming up on my second year. I am a psychology major as of right now and am looking to minor in education. I want to hopefully one day become a therapist, as I believe the importance of mental health. I have worked as a shadow in a few therapy clinics and offices and having been to therapy before, I know the real impact it can have. The stigma around mental health is slowly but surely lifting, but the conversation needs to be had more. I plan to go to grad school after receiving my bachelors degree. And after receiving my masters degree, I want to work in full time in a therapy office. While working in therapy clinics/offices the past few years I got to see up close and personal the real helping effects that therapy had for many people’s lives. Therapy is so incredibly nurturing to the mind and can also lead to other benefits as well. I have not had an incredible amount of work but I truly do believe that something is better than nothing. All throughout high school I would shadow and also work as the receptionist at a few therapy clinics/offices. And I also would volunteer in doctors offices and hospitals, just to gain experience and to be around that kind of environment too. During my last year of high school I had the opportunity to do research on the brain at USC. It was so interesting to be able to do research and to also find the negative effects of untreated concussions and brain injuries, especially when the brain has not fully formed quite yet. I think that people take for granted their brain which sounds little crazy but I truly do believe to protect the brain at all costs, because that is someone’s whole entire life. During my time at USC while doing research I got to meet so many doctors and researchers that I connected well with. They all believe the importance of therapy and mental health as well. And not only did I learn more about the brain I also learned more about brain health and things that we can do in our day to day lives that would help with the health of our brain. There are exercises like reading or learning something new in order to keep our minds active and not letting it mush away with just filling it with tv shows or movies or social media. And also with certain foods we eat which can also help with the health of our brains and can also help with diseases we might encounter later on in life and with any kind of other mental health issues that may occur. I think that mental health and brain health needs to be talked about more, and it is not talked about nearly enough. <br><br>

        Brain and mental health is so important.<br><br>

       Therapy is very important and vital to some people and is something to not be ashamed of.
